# SDSC "sdsc" roll

## Overview

This roll bundles a collection of files required for developing and using
Rocks rolls from the SDSC development group.

## Requirements

To build/install this roll you must have root access to a Rocks development
machine (e.g., a frontend or development appliance).

If your Rocks development machine does *not* have Internet access you must
download the appropriate R source file(s) using a machine that does have
Internet access and copy them into the `src/<packages>` directories on your
Rocks development machine.


## Dependencies

None.

## Building

To build the sdsc-roll, execute these instructions on a Rocks development
machine (e.g., a frontend or development appliance):

```shell
% make 2>&1 | tee build.log
% grep "RPM build error" build.log
```

If nothing is returned from the grep command then the roll should have been
created as... `sdsc-roll-*.iso`. If you built the roll on a Rocks frontend then
proceed to the installation step. If you built the roll on a Rocks development
appliance you need to copy the roll to your Rocks frontend before continuing
with installation.


## Installation

To install, execute these instructions on a Rocks frontend:

```shell
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll sdsc
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll sdsc | bash
```

## Testing

The sdsc-roll includes a test script which can be run to verify proper
installation of the roll documentation, binaries and module files. To run
the test scripts execute the following command(s):

```shell
% /root/rolltests/sdsc.t 
```
